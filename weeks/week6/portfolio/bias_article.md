# What is Bias in AI and How Can We Detect It?

Artificial Intelligence is not neutral. Data often contains hidden patterns or imbalances, and models trained on this data can reflect and amplify these biases.

## Example: Titanic Dataset
- Women had a survival rate of ~74%, men ~19%  
- Children (<18 years old) had a higher survival rate than adults  

These differences show how outcomes can depend heavily on group characteristics. In real-world AI applications (e.g., hiring, lending), unchecked bias can lead to unfair treatment.

**Key takeaway:** Bias often starts in the **data**. Checking for group differences before training models is essential for fairness.
