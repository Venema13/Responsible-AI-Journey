## ✍️ Update Log  

### Week 1: Repo created + joined AI Ethics Slack.  
### Week 2: Completed Elements of AI course + added AI terms.  
### Week 3: Finished 50 Python exercises (freeCodeCamp).  
### Week 4: Completed Statistics 101 (Khan Academy)  
📂 File added: `week4/stats_exercises.md`  
✨ Key insight: basic statistics and probability are crucial for AI fairness  

### Week 5: Completed Intro to Ethics  
📂 File added: `week5/ethics_blog.md`  
✨ Key insight: AI can make mistakes and bias, ethics helps make AI safe and trustworthy  

### Week 6: Bias & Security/Privacy Basics  
📂 Files added:  
- `week6/ethics/bias_titanic.ipynb` → Bias analysis notebook  
- `week6/privacy/privacy_test_report.md` → Mozilla Observatory privacy/security test report  
- `week6/privacy/fake_data_generator.py` → Python script for generating anonymized data  
- `week6/portfolio/bias_article.md` → Blog post on AI bias  
- `week6/portfolio/privacy_article.md` → Blog post on Privacy/Security  

✨ Key insights:  
- Ethics: Bias is often hidden in datasets. Checking group differences early prevents unfair outcomes.  
- Security/Privacy: Even large websites have privacy weaknesses. Small tools like Mozilla Observatory and anonymization scripts improve safety.  

### Week 7: Transparency & GDPR – LIME/SHAP, GDPR principles
📂 Files added/updated:
- `week7/Week7_Notebook.ipynb`
- `week7/Week7_Transparency_GDPR.md`
- `week7/lime_example.png`
- `week7/shap_summary.png`

✨ Key insights:
- Implemented LIME and SHAP for explainable AI
- Applied GDPR principles: data minimization, transparency, consent
- Added documentation and visualizations for compliance
  
### Week 8: Amazon Hiring Bias & Data Anonymization
📂 **Files added:**  
- `/weeks/week8/Week8_Amazon_CaseStudy.md`  
- `/weeks/week8/Week8_Case_Anon.md`  
- `/weeks/week8/Week8_Notebook.ipynb`  
- `/weeks/week8/synthetic_resumes.csv`  
- `/weeks/week8/anonymized_resumes.csv`  
- `/weeks/week8/fairness_plot.png`  
- `/weeks/week8/week8_blog.md`

✨ **Key Insights:**  
- **Bias in hiring AI**: Historical data can create unfair outcomes. The Amazon case shows why fairness checks are essential.  
- **Data anonymization**: PII (names, emails, phone numbers) must be replaced or masked to comply with GDPR.  
- **Fairness checks still needed**: Removing PII alone does not remove bias; synthetic labels and selection metrics help identify disparities.  
- **Synthetic data**: Safe way to test AI pipelines without using real candidate data.  

### Week 9 – Explainability & PII Detection
**Focus:** SHAP model explainability and personal data (PII) detection in datasets.  
**Goal:**  
- Understand model decisions using SHAP  
- Detect personal data (emails/phones) to ensure GDPR compliance  
- Document and visualize results  

📂**Files added:**
- `/weeks/week9/Week9_Notebook.ipynb` → Python notebook with model, SHAP, PII detection  
- `/weeks/week9/Week9_Explainability.md` → Markdown notes on SHAP explainability  
- `/weeks/week9/Week9_PII_Report.md` → PII detection report   

✨**Key Insights:**
- SHAP helps understand which features most influence model decisions  
- Text features like skills and extra_text contribute to predictions  
- PII detection ensures GDPR compliance before using datasets
