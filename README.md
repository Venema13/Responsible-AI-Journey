# Journey to AI Ethics, Compliance, Privacy & Security Specialist 🚀  

Welcome to my 52-week learning journey to become an **AI Ethics, Compliance, Privacy & Security Specialist**.  
I follow a structured 1-year plan (≈ 20 hours per week) with resources, hands-on projects, and portfolio deliverables.  
Here I track my progress: certificates, notes, code, and projects.

## ✍️ Update Log  

**Week 1:** Repo created + joined AI Ethics Slack.  
**Week 2:** Completed Elements of AI course + added AI terms.  
**Week 3:** Finished 50 Python exercises (freeCodeCamp).  
**Week 4:** Completed Statistics 101 (Khan Academy)  
📂 File added: `week4/stats_exercises.md`  
✨ Key insight: basic statistics and probability are crucial for AI fairness  

**Week 5:** Completed Intro to Ethics  
📂 File added: `week5/ethics_blog.md`  
✨ Key insight: AI can make mistakes and bias, ethics helps make AI safe and trustworthy  

**Week 6:** Bias & Security/Privacy Basics  
📂 Files added:  
- `week6/ethics/bias_titanic.ipynb` → Bias analysis notebook  
- `week6/privacy/privacy_test_report.md` → Mozilla Observatory privacy/security test report  
- `week6/privacy/fake_data_generator.py` → Python script for generating anonymized data  
- `week6/portfolio/bias_article.md` → Blog post on AI bias  
- `week6/portfolio/privacy_article.md` → Blog post on Privacy/Security  

✨ Key insights:  
- Ethics: Bias is often hidden in datasets. Checking group differences early prevents unfair outcomes.  
- Security/Privacy: Even large websites have privacy weaknesses. Small tools like Mozilla Observatory and anonymization scripts improve safety.  

**Week 7:** Transparency & GDPR – LIME/SHAP, GDPR principles
📂 Files added/updated:
- `week7/Week7_Notebook.ipynb`
- `week7/Week7_Transparency_GDPR.md`
- `week7/lime_example.png`
- `week7/shap_summary.png`

✨ Key insights:
- Implemented LIME and SHAP for explainable AI
- Applied GDPR principles: data minimization, transparency, consent
- Added documentation and visualizations for compliance
  
**Week 8:** Amazon Hiring Bias & Data Anonymization

📂 **Files added:**  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/Week8_Amazon_CaseStudy.md`  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/Week8_Case_Anon.md`  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/Week8_Notebook.ipynb`  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/synthetic_resumes.csv`  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/anonymized_resumes.csv`  
- `/weeks/week8/ethics_security_privacy/fairness_plot.png`  
- `/weeks/week8/portfolio/week8_blog.md`

✨ **Key Insights:**  
- **Bias in hiring AI**: Historical data can create unfair outcomes. The Amazon case shows why fairness checks are essential.  
- **Data anonymization**: PII (names, emails, phone numbers) must be replaced or masked to comply with GDPR.  
- **Fairness checks still needed**: Removing PII alone does not remove bias; synthetic labels and selection metrics help identify disparities.  
- **Synthetic data**: Safe way to test AI pipelines without using real candidate data.
